# BoC-Financial-Analysis-Project

**Description:**

In this project I will collect and clean USD/CAD exchange-rate data to build a dataset that tracks daily percent changes and flags when the Canadian dollar weakens. I will then create 2–3 charts to visualize the USD/CAD trend over time and the distribution of daily up/down movements. Finally, I will build an interpretable model to identify which variables best explain CAD weakening days and summarize the results with a straightforward impact/weight ranking.

**What is the final output of this project?**<br/>

Final deliverables:

Output 1: A clean dataset (created by you) <br/>
clean_dataset.csv: Contains date, USD/CAD, daily % change, and whether CAD weakened (0/1)

Output 2: 2–3 charts<br/>
USD/CAD Time Series Trend<br/>
Distribution of Daily USD/CAD Changes (Frequency of Up/Down Movements)

Output 3: A simple “interpretable” model result<br/>
Which variables best explain days when CAD weakened?<br/>
Model “Weight/Impact” Ranking (Similar to your Steam project's “Factor Ranking”)
