# BoC-Financial-Analysis-Project

**What is the final output of this project? (This is the “purpose”)**<br/>

Final deliverables:

Output 1: A clean dataset (created by you) <br/>
clean_dataset.csv: Contains date, USD/CAD, daily % change, and whether CAD weakened (0/1)

Output 2: 2–3 charts<br/>
USD/CAD Time Series Trend<br/>
Distribution of Daily USD/CAD Changes (Frequency of Up/Down Movements)

Output 3: A simple “interpretable” model result<br/>
Which variables best explain days when CAD weakened?<br/>
Model “Weight/Impact” Ranking (Similar to your Steam project's “Factor Ranking”)
